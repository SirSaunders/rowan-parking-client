The viewable information includes (but is not limited to): amount of open parking spots, amount of reservable spots, and times that a specific lot can be accessed. By keeping record of the amount of users that enter a parking lot the system generates a cumulative total of open spots and displays that total to the user. This system can generate as many lots as needed and concurrent user will always have updated totals on lot usage. All parking related problems can be reported to facilities through the system available on mobile, and web devices.',
